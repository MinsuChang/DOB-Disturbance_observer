# Advanced Control

This repository contains MATLAB codes for various feedback control simulations, covering advanced control techniques such as disturbance observers, zero-phase error tracking control, and linear quadratic regulators.

## Contents

- **[Assist_as_needed_switching.m](Assist_as_needed_switching.m)**: MATLAB script implementing assist-as-needed switching control.
- **[DOB_ZOH_PAA_1_LPF2nd_Final.m](DOB_ZOH_PAA_1_LPF2nd_Final.m)**: Implementation of Disturbance Observer (DOB) with Zero-Order Hold (ZOH), PAA (Parameter Adaptation Algorithm) control, and a second-order low-pass filter.
- **[Prob6_LQR.m](Prob6_LQR.m)**: MATLAB code for Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (for running the `.m` files)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mincasurong/Advanced_control.git
    cd Advanced_control
    ```

2. Open the desired `.m` file in MATLAB and run it to see the results of the control simulations.

### Example

To run the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) simulation:
1. Open `Prob6_LQR.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to simulate the LQR control.
